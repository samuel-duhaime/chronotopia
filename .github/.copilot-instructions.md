# Project Overview

Chronotopia is a 4X space deckbuilding game built with Phaser, TypeScript, Vite, and React. It uses Zustand for state management and features hexagonal maps with planets, fleets, commanders, and resources.

## Folder Structure

- `/public/assets`: Game assets (images, sounds)
- `/src/features/commander`: Commander management
- `/src/features/common`: Common utilities and types
- `/src/features/fleet`: Fleet management
- `/src/features/game`: Core game logic and state management
- `/src/features/map`: Map rendering and hex-based gameplay
- `/src/features/ui`: UI components and layout
- `/src/styles`: Global styles

## Libraries and Frameworks

- React and TypeScript for the frontend
- Phaser for game rendering and interactions
- Zustand for state management
- CSS for styling

## Coding Standards

- Use parameter destructuring for every function: `({ param1, param2 }) => {}`
- Use TypeScript strict typing
- Use arrow functions for components and callbacks
- Store data logic in Zustand stores, keep Phaser classes for rendering only
- Add minimalist comments for each logical step to improve code readability
- Document all functions with JSDoc comments including parameters, return values, and description
